\enquote{...urban road systems can be (in good approximation) considered as planar networks, i.e., links cannot \enquote{cross} each other without forming a physical intersection (node) as long as there are no tunnels or bridges... The meaningful definition of link angles requires the presence of a planar network, which is assumed to be the case in urban road systems.} \citep[pp.~563~\&~567]{chan_urban_2011} \\ \hline
